   	  <p id="p1">SQL tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of SQL. Our SQL tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database such as updating records, deleting records, creating and modifying tables, views, etc.SQL is just a query language; it is not a database. To perform SQL queries, you need to install any database, for example, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, PostGre SQL, SQL Server, DB2, etc.

   	  	The SQL programming language was first developed in the 1970s by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. The programming language, known then as SEQUEL, was created following the publishing of Edgar Frank Todd's paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks," in 1970.In his paper, Todd proposed that that all data in a database be represented in the form of relations. It was based on this theory that Boyce and Chamberlin came up with SQL. In the book "Oracle Quick Guides (Cornelio Books 2013)," author Malcolm Coxall writes that the original SQL version was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original relational database management systems known as "System R."It wasn't until several years later, however, that the SQL language was made available publicly. In 1979, a company called Relational Software, which later became oracle, commercially released its own version of the SQL language called Oracle V2.
